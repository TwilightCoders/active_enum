# ActiveEnum

ActiveRecord lacks solid meaniningful support for true enumeration in databases. The best, most efficient enumerations are stored as integers, however numbers are often less meaningful to humans. To combat this, ActiveEnum aims to converts quickly and efficiently between different formats when reading from and writing to a database.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_enum'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_enum

## Usage
